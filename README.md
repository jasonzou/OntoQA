# OntoQA (forked from spkang/OntoQA)
OntoQA is forked from spkang/OntoQA. However, whether this is the OntoQA is questionable.

OntoQA is a framework that evaluates ontologies related to a certain set of terms and then ranks them according a set of metrics that captures different aspects of ontologies. Since there are no global criteria defining how a good ontology should be, OntoQA allows users to tune the ranking towards certain features of ontologies to suit the need of their applications. http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~budak/papers/ontoqa.pdf
